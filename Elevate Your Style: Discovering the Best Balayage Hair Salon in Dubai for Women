What is Balayage?
Balayage is a French hair coloring technique that involves hand-painting highlights onto the hair to create a natural, sun-kissed effect. Unlike traditional foil highlights, balayage allows for a softer, more blended look, with seamless transitions between shades. This versatile technique can be customized to suit any hair type or color, making it a popular choice for women looking to add dimension and depth to their locks.
